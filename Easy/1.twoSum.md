# Two Sum

## Description

```md
* Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

* You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

* You can return the answer in any order.

- Example 1:
    Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
    Output: [0,1]
    Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

- Example 2:
    Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
    Output: [1,2]

- Example 3:
    Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
    Output: [0,1]
```

## Brute Force

In this problem we are provided with an array of n numbers and an integer target, a Sum of two items in the array should equal to the target.

The solution should output the indices of the items. We can think of a solution to iterate through the array and use the target as a condition.

```dart
class Solution {
  List<int> twoSum(List<int> nums, int target) {
    int n = nums.length;
    for(var i = 0; i < n - 1; i++){
        for(var j = i + 1; j < n; j++ ){
            if(nums[i]+nums[j] == target){
                return([i,j]);
            }
        }
    }
    return[];
  }
}
```

Final Summary :

- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n^2) \)
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \)
